# Describe the Problem - Write your answers as comments:
# 1. What is the for loop doing?
# i changing value iteratedly from in range of 1 to 20
# # 2. When is the function meant to print "You got it"?
# when i equal to 20
# # 3. What are your assumptions about the value of i?
# i will never reach  20 bc it stops at 19
